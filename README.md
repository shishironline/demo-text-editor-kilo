# demo-text-editor-kilo

Started this project after reading about it on Hacker News - [Build Your Own Text Editor (2017) (viewsourcecode.org)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33581856)

Forked from original by [snaptoken/kilo-tutorial](https://github.com/snaptoken/kilo-tutorial)

The idea is get it working in C language, and then using it for learning a new language or idea as expressed in the original [antirez/kilo](https://github.com/antirez/kilo):

People are encouraged to use it as a starting point to write other editors or command line interfaces that are more advanced than the usual REPL style CLI.
